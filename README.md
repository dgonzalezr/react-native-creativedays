## Prerequisites

The following dependencies must be installed before starting the application:

### NodeJS and NPM

Install `Nodejs` and `npm` if the are not already installed on your machine.
Can be download and installed from the [official site](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
Please, make sure you have installed `Node.js 6.x.x` and `npm 4.x.x` or less.

_Note:_ _version of npm@^5.x.x not yet supported by `create-react-native-app` command utility_

### Yarn

You can choose to [install Yarn Package Manager](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) instead of NPM.

## How to use

You can start by cloning the latest version of this repository on your local machine by running:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/dgonzalezr/react-native-creativedays.git

$ cd ./react-native-creativedays

```

### Install project dependencies by executing

#### `$ npm install` or `$ yarn install`

### Start the application

#### `$ npm start` or `$ yarn start`

Runs your app in development mode.

Open it in the [Expo app](https://expo.io) on your phone to view it, by scanning the QR Code or entering the expo URL (e.g. `exp://172.116.100.761:19000`). It will reload if you save edits to your files, and you will see build errors and logs in the terminal.

Sometimes you may need to reset or clear the React Native packager's cache. To do so, you can pass the `--reset-cache` flag to the start script:

```
npm start -- --reset-cache
```

or

```
yarn start -- --reset-cache
```
